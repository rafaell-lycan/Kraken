    <h1>Heroku and Passenger: focus on the app performance</h1>
    <p><a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> is an excellent and popular hosting service for web apps. Being a fully hosted service, you will never have to wake up in the morning to blinking lights on your phone, notifying you of text messages and
      missed calls, as well as a lot of mail, all trying to tell you that your server has been down since 3AM. Combined with its ease of use, it is no wonder that Heroku is becoming more and more popular.</p>

    <p>In fact, it's pretty hard for me to write down that sentence 'cause I don't know if I should feel proud or ashamed of it. The thing is, 2015 was an exception.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>January</strong>, started to live together with Carol. The craziest yet most loving little girl in the planet.</li>
      <li><strong>March</strong>, moved to US for good. A plan I had for a very long time finally became true.</li>
      <li><strong>April</strong>, rented and furnished my entire home for the first time. Thanks IKEA &lt;3</li>
      <li><strong>June</strong>, bought my first car. I never liked cars but it's impossible to not have one in LA.</li>
      <li><strong>November</strong>, <a href="https://twitter.com/zenorocha/status/662673751373287424">got a dog</a>. Which makes me think: "How could I lived without one for such a long time?".</li>
